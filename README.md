# CIS-304-Portfolio-Code-2

This program uses functions and a switch statement to determine a choice from a menu of choices with numerical values.

The menu looks like this:

  Health Club Membership Menu

  1. Standard Adult Membership
  2. Child Membership
  3. Senior Citizen Membership
  4. Quit the Program

and accepts the number represented on the far left of the options as input.
If a number not listed as an option is used as input, an error message will occur as such:

The valid choices are 1 through 4. Run the program again and select one of those.

After choosing an option, the user is asked to enter an amount of months for membership. An error message will appear if the input is zero
or anything with a negative value. After giving the amount of months, the program calculates the total charges and prints them to the screen.
The program will then loop back to the menu where you can choose another option or quit the program.
